  "gonorrheaSymptoms": "Most women with gonorrhea do not have any symptoms. Even when a woman has symptoms, they are often mild and can be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection. Women with gonorrhea are at risk of developing serious complications from the infection, even if they don’t have any symptoms. Symptoms in women can include: Painful or burning sensation when urinating; increased vaginal discharge; and vaginal bleeding between periods.",
  "gonorrheaDiagnosis": "Most of the time, urine can be used to test for gonorrhea. However, if you have had oral and/or anal sex, swabs may be used to collect samples from your throat and/or rectum. In some cases, a swab may be used to collect a sample from a man’s urethra or a woman’s cervix.",
  "gonorrheaTreatment": "Gonorrhea can be cured with the right treatment. CDC now recommends dual therapy (i.e. using two drugs) for the treatment of gonorrhea. It is important to take all of the medication prescribed to cure gonorrhea.",
  "gonorrheaConsequences": "Untreated gonorrhea can cause serious and permanent health problems in both women and men. In women, untreated gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). In men, gonorrhea can cause a painful condition in the tubes attached to the testicles. In rare cases, this may cause a man to be sterile, or prevent him from being able to father a child.",
  "gonorrheaSafeSex": "You should wait seven days after finishing all medications before having sex. To avoid getting infected with gonorrhea again or spreading gonorrhea to your partner(s), you and your sex partner(s) should avoid having sex until you have each completed treatment. If you’ve had gonorrhea and took medicine in the past, you can still get infected again if you have unprotected sex with a person who has gonorrhea.",
  "chlamydiaSymptoms": "Most people who have chlamydia have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may not appear until several weeks after you have sex with an infected partner. Women with symptoms may notice an abnormal vaginal discharge and/or a burning sensation when urinating.",
  "chlamydiaDiagnosis": "Laboratory tests can diagnose chlamydia. Your health care provider may ask you to provide a urine sample or may use a cotton swab to get a sample from your vagina to test for chlamydia.",
  "chlamydiaTreatment": "Chlamydia can be easily cured with antibiotics. Repeat infection with chlamydia is common. You should be tested again about three months after you are treated, even if your sex partner was treated.",
  "chlamydiaConsequences": "If you are a woman, untreated chlamydia can spread to your uterus and fallopian tubes. This can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Men rarely have health problems linked to chlamydia. Infection sometimes spreads to the tube that carries sperm from the testicles, causing pain and fever. ",
  "chlamydiaSafeSex": "You should not have sex again until you and your sex partner(s) have completed treatment. If your doctor prescribes a single dose of medication, you should wait seven days after taking the medicine before having sex. If your doctor prescribes a medicine for you to take for seven days, you should wait until you have taken all of the doses before having sex.",
  "HPVSymptoms": "Most people with HPV do not know they are infected and never develop symptoms or health problems from it. Some people find out they have HPV when they get genital warts. Women may find out they have HPV when they get an abnormal Pap test result (during cervical cancer screening). Others may only find out once they’ve developed more serious problems from HPV, such as cancers.",
  "HPVDiagnosis": "Get vaccinated. The HPV vaccine is safe and effective. It can protect against diseases (including cancers) caused by HPV when given in the recommended age groups. Get screened for cervical cancer. Routine screening for women aged 21 to 65 years old can prevent cervical cancer.",
  "HPVTreatment": "For prevention, HPV vaccination is recommended at age 11 or 12 years and for everyone through age 26 years, if not vaccinated already. There is no treatment for the virus itself. However, there are treatments for the health problems that HPV can cause such as genital warts and cervical precancer.",
  "HPVConsequences": "When HPV does not go away, it can cause health problems like genital warts and cancer. HPV can cause cervical and other cancers including cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, or anus. It can also cause cancer in the back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils.",
  "HPVSafeSex": "HPV can be passed even when an infected person has no signs or symptoms. Use latex condoms the right way every time you have sex. At any age, having a new sex partner is a risk factor for getting a new HPV infection. People who are already in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship are not likely to get a new HPV infection.",
  "genitalHerpesSymptoms": "Most people who have genital herpes have no symptoms or have very mild symptoms. You may not notice mild symptoms, or you may mistake them for another skin condition, such as a pimple or ingrown hair. Herpes sores usually appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum, or mouth. The blisters break and leave painful sores that may take a week or more to heal.",
  "genitalHerpesDiagnosis": "Your healthcare provider may diagnose genital herpes by simply looking at your symptoms. Providers can also take a sample from the sore(s) and test it. In certain situations, a blood test may be used to look for herpes antibodies.",
  "genitalHerpesTreatment": "There is no cure for herpes. However, there are medicines that can prevent or shorten outbreaks. One of these anti-herpes medicines can be taken daily and makes it less likely that you will pass the infection on to your sex partner.",
  "genitalHerpesConsequences": "Genital herpes can cause painful genital sores and can be severe in people with suppressed immune systems. If you touch your sores or the fluids from the sores, you may transfer herpes to another part of your body, such as your eyes. Do not touch the sores or fluids to avoid spreading herpes to another part of your body.",
  "genitalHerpesSafeSex": "HPV can be passed even when an infected person has no signs or symptoms. Use latex condoms the right way every time you have sex. At any age, having a new sex partner is a risk factor for getting a new HPV infection. People who are already in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship are not likely to get a new HPV infection.",
  "syphilisSymptoms": "Syphilis is divided into stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. A person with primary syphilis generally has a sore or sores at the original site of infection. These sores usually occur on or around the genitals, around the anus or in the rectum, or in or around the mouth. These sores are usually firm, round, and painless. Symptoms of secondary syphilis include skin rash, swollen lymph nodes, and fever. During the latent stage, there are no signs or symptoms. Tertiary syphilis is associated with severe medical problems.  It can affect the heart, brain, and other organs of the body.",
  "syphilisDiagnosis": "Most of the time, a blood test is used to test for syphilis. Some health care providers will diagnose syphilis by testing fluid from a syphilis sore.",
  "syphilisTreatment": "Syphilis can be cured with the right antibiotics from your health care provider. The recommended treatment for adults and adolescents with primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis is Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units administered intramuscularly in a single dose. ",
  "syphilisConsequences": "Without treatment, syphilis can spread to the brain and nervous system (neurosyphilis) or to the eye (ocular syphilis). Symptoms of neurosyphilis include severe headache; difficulty coordinating muscle movements; paralysis (not able to move certain parts of your body); numbness; and Dementia. Symptoms of ocular syphilis include changes in your vision and even blindness.",
  "syphilisSafeSex": "Persons who receive syphilis treatment must abstain from sexual contact with new partners until the syphilis sores are completely healed. Persons with syphilis must notify their sex partners so that they also can be tested and receive treatment if necessary.",
  "bacterialVaginosisSymptoms": "Many women with BV do not have symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you may notice: A thin white or gray vaginal discharge; Pain, itching, or burning in the vagina. A strong fish-like odor, especially after sex. Burning when urinating. Itching around the outside of the vagina.",
  "bacterialVaginosisDiagnosis": "A health care provider will examine your vagina for signs of vaginal discharge. Your provider can also perform laboratory tests on a sample of vaginal fluid to determine if BV is present.",
  "bacterialVaginosisTreatment": "It is important that you take all of the medicine prescribed to you, even if your symptoms go away. A health care provider can treat BV with antibiotics, but BV may return even after treatment. Male sex partners of women diagnosed with BV generally do not need to be treated. BV may be transferred between female sex partners.",
  "bacterialVaginosisConsequences": "BV can cause some serious health risks, including: Increasing your chance of getting HIV if you have sex with someone who is infected with HIV; Making it more likely that you will deliver your baby too early if you have BV while pregnant; Increasing your chance of getting other STDs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea.",
  "bacterialVaginosisSafeSex": "Women should be advised to refrain from sexual activity or use condoms consistently and correctly during the treatment regimen. Douching might increase the risk for relapse.",
  "trichomoniasisSymptoms": "About 70% of infected people do not have any signs or symptoms. Some people with symptoms get them within 5 to 28 days after being infected. Women with trichomoniasis may notice: Itching, burning, redness or soreness of the genitals; Discomfort with urination; A change in their vaginal discharge that can be clear, white, yellowish, or greenish with an unusual fishy smell.",
  "trichomoniasisDiagnosis": "It is not possible to diagnose trichomoniasis based on symptoms alone. For both men and women, your health care provider can examine you and get a laboratory test to diagnose trichomoniasis.",
  "trichomoniasisTreatment": "Trichomoniasis can be treated with medication (either metronidazole or tinidazole). These pills are taken by mouth. It is safe for pregnant women to take this medication. It is not recommended to drink alcohol within 24 hours after taking this medication.",
  "trichomoniasisConsequences": "Trichomoniasis can increase the risk of getting or spreading other sexually transmitted infections. For example, trichomoniasis can cause genital inflammation that makes it easier to get infected with HIV, or to pass the HIV virus on to a sex partner.",
  "trichomoniasisSafeSex": "People who have been treated for trichomoniasis can get it again. To avoid getting reinfected, make sure that all of your sex partners get treated. Also, wait 7- 10 days after you and your partner have been treated to have sex again. ",
  "HIVAIDSSymptoms": "Some people may experience a flu-like illness within 2 to 4 weeks after infection (Stage 1 HIV infection). But some people may not feel sick during this stage. Flu-like symptoms include fever, chills, rash, night sweats, muscle aches, sore throat, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, or mouth ulcers. These symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks. During this time, HIV infection may not show up on an HIV test, but people who have it are highly infectious and can spread the infection to others.",
  "HIVAIDSDiagnosis": "You can ask your health care provider for an HIV test. Many medical clinics, substance abuse programs, community health centers, and hospitals offer them too. There are three types of tests available: nucleic acid tests (NAT), antigen/antibody tests, and antibody tests. HIV tests are typically performed on blood or oral fluid. They may also be performed on urine.",
  "HIVAIDSTreatment": "HIV treatment involves taking medicines that slow the progression of the virus in your body. HIV is a type of virus called a retrovirus, and the combination of drugs used to treat it is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). Although a cure for HIV does not yet exist, ART can keep you healthy for many years, ART reduces the amount of virus (or viral load) in your blood and body fluids. ART is usually taken as a combination of 3 or more drugs to have the greatest chance of lowering the amount of HIV in your body.",
  "HIVAIDSConsequences": "Opportunistic infections are infections that occur more frequently and are more severe in people with weakened immune systems, including people with HIV. However, many people with HIV still develop OIs because they may not know they have HIV, they may not be on treatment, or their treatment may not be keeping their HIV levels low enough for their immune system to fight off infections. The best ways to prevent getting an opportunistic infection are to get into care and to take HIV medications as prescribed.",
  "HIVAIDSSafeSex": "HIV medicine lowers the amount of virus (viral load) in your body and taking it as prescribed can make your viral load undetectable. If your viral load stays undetectable, you have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to an HIV-negative partner through sex. Use condoms the right way every time you have anal or vaginal sex.",
